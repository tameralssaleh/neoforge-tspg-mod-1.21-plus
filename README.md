# Tamer's Slow Progression Mod (TSPG)
Do you prefer Minecraft to just progress a little bit slower? 
Do you prefer just a little extra to be integrated into survival mod?
Do you hate it when the Minecraft phase only lasts two weeks?
- If you have said yes to any of these questions, then TSPG is for you!
## What is TSPG?
Tamer's Slow Progression Mod (TSPG) is a Minecraft mod designed to just make the traditional survival mode... well- a bit more slower paced. TSPG adds extra steps to make the general flow of progression not only take a little longer, but also feel a bit more realistic if you are a player who loves realism in Minecraft!
## Mod Information
- Mod Name: Tamer's Slow Progression Mod (TSPG)

## What Does TSPG Change?
TSPG changes the following game mechanics:
### Tree Punching
TSPG removes the ability to punch trees in survival mode. You will need to first obtain a flint axe in order to begin chopping trees.
### Flint Tools
Flint tools are a TSPG toolset designed to be the first set of tools you obtain in your world. 
Here is a list of all flint tools:
- Flint Sword
- Flint Pickaxe
- Flint Axe
- Flint Shovel
- Flint Hoe
- Flint Knife (a new tool that can be used as a weak weapon, or as a tool to carve wood, clean leather, etc)
### Flint Tool Crafting
Flint tools are crafted by first creating tool heads/blades. To create a flint tool head/blade, you will need to obtain flint shards. Flint shards are obtained by taking flint and right clicking on stone with it to knapp it into flint shards. There is a chance that knapping can fail, and flint is consumed with no flint shards produced. Once you have obtained enough flint shards, you can craft them into tool heads/blades by arranging them in the crafting grid in the shape of the tool you want to create.
- For example: To create a flint pickaxe head, you would arrange three flint shards horizontally in the top row of a 3x3 crafting grid. For a sword blade, just place two flint shards vertically in a 2x2 or 3x3 crafting grid. The crafting recipe for flint tool heads/blades is shapeless, so as long as the flint shards are arranged in the correct shape, it will work.
### Flint Tool Assembly
After you have crafted the flint tool heads/blades, you will need to obtain plant fibers to create plant string. Plant string is used to bind the flint tool heads/blades to sticks to create the final flint tool product. To create plant string, you will need to obtain plant fibers by breaking grass and then combining four of them in a 2x2 or 3x3 crafting grid. Once you have plant string, you can then combine it with the flint tool head/blade, and a stick in a 2x2 or 3x3 crafting grid. Congratulations! You have now created your first flint tool!
### Flint Tool Durability
Flint tools have low durability (70 uses) and can be repaired using flint flint or flint shards.
